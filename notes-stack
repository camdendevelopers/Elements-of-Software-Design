Stack is an ordered collection of elements where the addition of new items and removal of existing items ONLY take place at the same end (called the top)

Imagine a stack of trays 
You take the top tray and so on until they replace them. So bottom trays never get accessed. (LIFO method)

Image that you have a railroad,how can you you reverse the direction of the train


when you create a card onject does it return anything? YES
newCard = Card() it returns the pointer of the card

s = Stack()
args = none
returns: new stack

s.push() insert new elements on the top of stack s
args = items you want to insert
return = nothing

s.pop() remove item from the top of stack s
args: None
returns = top element of the stack


s.peek() look at the top element in stack s
args: None
returns = top element of the stack 

s.isEmpty() returns true if there are no elements in stack s
args: None
returns: Boolean

s.size() the number of elements in stack s
args: None
returns: number of elements
