I = OOP
II = Abstract Data Types

Concrete vs Abstract Data Types

Concrete = tied to its internal representation

Abstract data type = ADT is a means for storing and accessing data without concern of the details of its implementation

int = 1 byte or 8 bits #Before
int = 32 bit number #now


float = 32 bits
double = 64 bits

int and floats are concrete

another example 
array are concrete (different from python list)
