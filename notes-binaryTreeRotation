#AVL tree
Adelson-Welskii and Landis tree
First thing: A balance factor: the height of the left subtree - height of the right subtree

The balance factor of all leaf nodes is zero.
A tree is considered balance if the balance factor is -1, 0, or 1

/// LEFT ROTATION
1. If the balance factor of a node is -2, then the right subtree is two nodes deeper than the left subtree
2. If the balance factor of a the right child is also negative, then we do a left rotation on that node
3. Left rotation: 1) Promote the right child to be the new root 2) Move the old root to be the left child of the new root 3) if the new root already has a left child, make it the right child of the new left child (Guaranteed to be vacant)

/// RIGHT ROTATION
1. If the balance factor of a node is 2, then the left subtree is two nodes deeper than the right subtree
2. If the balance factor of a the right child is also positive, then we do a rogjt rotation on that node
3. Right rotation: 1) Promote the left child to be the new root 2) Move the old root to be the right child of the new root 3) if the new root already has a right child, make it the left child of the new right child (Guaranteed to be vacant)\
RIGHT ROTATION EXAMPLE
          x
      t       z
   r     v
    s

        =>
          t
      r        y
        s    v   z
     \

  /// SPECIAL CASES

Instead of doing a left rotation, do a right rotation on the new root node first, then do the left rotation
