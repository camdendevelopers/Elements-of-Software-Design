Searching: An algorithmic process of finding a particular item within a collection of items.

-It can return True or False
-It can return a way of identifying where the item was found.

Sequential search:  start at the first element proceed in a liner fashion until you either find it or determine its' not present.

Algorithm complexity:
Measure the runtime (Problem: Depends on data, hardware, other programs running)

Since we have too many things  that affect it you count comparisons

UNORDERED
if the item is present:
  Best case: first element O(1)
  Worst case: last element O(n)
  Average case: O(n)

If the item is not present:
  NO BEST CASE SCENARIO O(n)

ORDERED
if the item is present:
  Best case: First element O(1)
  Worst case: Last element O(n)
  Average: O(n)

if the item is not present
  Best case: Element is less than first element O(1)
  Worst case: Element is greater than last element O(n)
  Average case:
